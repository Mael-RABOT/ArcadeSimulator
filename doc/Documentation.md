## 1. Interfaces

The project is divided into 2 main interfaces:

- [IDisplayModule](IDisplayModule.md)
- [IGameModule](IGameModule.md)

These interfaces are used to create the graphical and game modules.<br>
They are used to create the dynamic libraries that will be loaded at runtime by the core of the program.
